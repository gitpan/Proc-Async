Use files in this directory to create a small (testing) web
application on your web server. Here is what you need to do:

1. Make sure that the module Proc::Async (and its dependencies) is
   installed on your web server machine.

2. Make the content of the "cgi-bin" sub-directory available on your
   web server as the cgi-bin scripts. For example by linking this
   sub-directory from the "/usr/lib/cgi-bin/" under the name
   "extester".

3. Make the content of the "html" sub-directory available on your web
   server as document pages. For example by linking this sub-directory
   from the "/var/www/" under the name "extester".

4. Edit "html/extester.html" and change there the URL of the cgi-bin
   script "monitor.pl" (which depends where you put it in the step 2
   above). There are two places where to edit this URL.

5. Finally, restart your web server.
